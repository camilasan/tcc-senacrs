UMLViewCanvas::Q3Canvas -> QGraphicsScene
Seta a cor do background do grid. É o view para os diagramas.


QGraphicsScene is the closest equivalent to Q3Canvas. 
The view for the diagrams.

There is no QPixmap based constructor, and the concept of tiles is gone. You can use QGraphicsScene::backgroundBrush to set a brush pattern for the background, or reimplement QGraphicsScene::drawBackground() in a QGraphicsScene subclass (see Porting scenes with tiles). In addition, the QGraphicsScene geometry is provided as a full QRectF. Instead of Q3Canvas(int width, int height), you can use QGraphicsScene(int top, int left, int width, int height).

LinePath::QObject  - seria a linha da Ellipse ja que o Q3CanvasEllipse apenas desenha ellipses cheias.
Circle::Q3CanvasEllipse -> QGraphicsEllipseItem - desenha a ellipse
SubsetSymbol::Q3CanvasEllipse -> QGraphicsEllipseItem - seta a enclinação do sub set symbol (do simbolo do meio em um grupo)


SeqLineWidget::Q3CanvasLine -> QGraphicsLineItem
Widget class for graphical representation of sequence lines

UMLView::Q3CanvasView -> QGraphicsView
 * UMLView instances represent diagrams.
 * The UMLApp instance manages a QWidgetStack of UMLView instances.
 * The visible diagram is at the top of stack.
 * The UMLView class inherits from QCanvasView and it owns the
 * objects displayed on its related QCanvas (see m_WidgetList.)

UMLWidget::Q3CanvasRectangle -> QGraphicsRectItem
This is the base class for nearly all graphical widgets.
