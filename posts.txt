Building a sexy Umbrello

Why is so sexy?
. It is a cool open source tools for UML.
. There is not a plenty cool open source tools for UML
. It is the only one in KDE Dev Platform.
. The most of the tools are developed in Java.
. There is cool features:
  . Automatic code generation (Ada, C++, C#, Java, perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.)
  . Import classes
  . Import project (Ada, C++, IDL, Java, Pascal and Python only)

But...
. There is a lack of love and attention.

What we need to do:
  . Complete QGraphicsView porting 
  . Better stereotypes supports 
  . Hyperlinks support 
  . Reuse KDevelop analysis for code import 
  . Complete UML2 support 
  . Complete Undo/Redo support
